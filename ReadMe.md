# RCES FINAL PROJECT
# SHANICE BAILEY (STB2145)

My class project will involve replicating figures created by Armitage et al. in their paper, "Dynamic Topography and Sea Level Anomalies of the Southern Ocean: Variability and Teleconnections" (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/2017JC013534).

I will be using datasets from:
1) CryoSat-2: Dynamic Topography of Southern Ocean - https://rkwok.jpl.nasa.gov/cryosat2/download_topo.html
2) ERA-Interim: wind data - http://kage.ldeo.columbia.edu:81/home/.datasets/.ERAInterim/.monthly/

I will try to replicate the figures 4a), 5a), 6b) (timeseries and map projection), 7a), and 10a) in the paper. 

> Figure 5 shows the seasonal variability of the Weddell Gyre. 
> Figure 6 shows the nonseasonal gyre depth and nonseasonal wind curl. 
> And if I have time I would like to also try to replicate Figure 7 the sea level difference and change in current speed between Autumn (AMJ) and Spring (OND).
